## MASTER THESIS - The Role of the Girardin Policy in the Energy Transition of French Overseas Territories
This thesis examines the role of the Girardin industriel tax incentive in financing the energy
transition in French Overseas Territory. It analyzes how this fiscal mechanism has supported
renewable energy investments within the island’s unique insular context, marked by high costs,
grid constraints, and ambitious decarbonization targets. By combining quantitative data and
stakeholder perspectives, the research evaluates the effectiveness, efficiency, and limitations of
Girardin as a policy tool, and discusses its place among alternative financing instruments for
achieving sustainable energy objectives.
